# Repository pattern not used here (which I use moslty) due to size of project
# No services added - not required for this tiny proj
# Auto Mapper not used -because simple model/entity 
# connection string uses - use linux sql server docker image because I developed it on a Mac.(Azure Data Studio)
# Any 'namespace' not include since developed using VS Code - Visual Studio Automatically brings that
